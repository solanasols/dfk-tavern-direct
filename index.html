      Well all the smart people accepted the help I offered to access the DFK tavern without having to wait forever, the rest decided blindly that I was a scammer, dude, read the source code!
      Anyway, I am NOT going to accept this. Go F*** yourself DefiKingdoms. I will never ever ever ever ever again try to help out other people by sacrificing my own weekend. Hell no! Go to hell, I don't care!
      The even smarter people know where to find the source code of this repo and can run it on their own clone (I'm not angry with them. I am furious with being treated like shit because I was actually trying to be helpful - hell no, never again)
