      <p>After having a talk with some community devs: I have taken this tool offline as in order for the "buy hero" feature to work one needs to sign a transaction, for which one needs the private key of the user's wallet.
      The preferred way of doing that would be a full Metamask integration, for which I unfortunately don't have time.
      I could modify the page to run without that feature, but it plain and simply won't make much sense - as the few buyable heroes usually don't show up in the tavern - so no, you cannot go and use the site to find that one buyable hero listed in the tavern (unless you are looking for a way overpriced hero), because everyboday already bought all heroes that show up there that are priced nicely.</p>
      <p>Thus:</p>
      <p>If you are a developer: You can find the source code at: https://github.com/solanasols/dfk-tavern-direct</p>
      <p>Read through the code (it is short enough) and if you decide (for yourself) that everything is fine - open ./dist/index2.html to run it (if you modify something in the index.js, run npm i and npx webpack)</p>
      <p>And: As before: This is a simple offering trying to help you out. I wrote this originally for myself and myself only (and in the future I will not do frontends anymore, either you are a coder and know to run an app in Visual Studio Code yourself or, well, bad luck for you).</p>
      <p>So: DISCLAIMER: This app/repo is provided as is. Please use at your own risk! (We will not be liable for any bugs, errors etc.)</p>
